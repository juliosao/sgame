# sgame
A tiny library to make 2D Games

Sgame provides a tiny set of java classes for creating 2D games for android using OpenGLES 2.0
At this moment there are a very basic set of functions including:
- "Brains" : Objects controlling game logic
- "Sprites" : Objects displayed on screen
- "Maps" : A graphic resource
- "SGameSurfaceView" : A hardware accelerated view for displaying games
